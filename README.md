HOW DOES THAT WORK
After logging in or registering on the site, you are directed to a catalog with all kinds of products. The customer can choose between various brands and various accessories that are most interesting and useful for his device. Each brand has its own section for both telephone devices and dedicated accessories. After the customer has chosen the product to buy, he will choose the payment method he prefers and within 24 hours the package will be entrusted to a courier and the customer will be provided via email with the tracking code of the shipment. After 48/72 hours the customer will receive the phone with the possibility of making a return before 30 days from delivery. The idea is to create a platform where you can buy both new or refurbished phones and accessories.
